# Express.js notes  

  * scaffolding  
  * routes  
  * templates/templating  
  * views (view engine??)  
  * middleware  
  * node_modules vs node modules  
    * npm packages || external node depencenies go in the node_modules dir & are managed through the package.json  and var example = require('example');  
    * node modules are blocks of functionality that are internal dependencies located in another file or dir  var example = require('./lib/example');  
    * convention is for node modules to reside in a lib dir  
  *
