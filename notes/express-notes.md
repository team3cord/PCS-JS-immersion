# Express.js notes  

  * scaffolding  
  * routes  
  * templates/templating  
  * views (view engine??)  
  * middleware  
  * node_modules vs node modules  
    * npm packages || external node depencenies go in the node_modules dir & are managed through the package.json  and var example = require('example');  
    * node modules are blocks of functionality that are internal dependencies located in another file or dir  var example = require('./lib/example');  
    * convention is for node modules to reside in a lib dir  
  * QA  
      * reach => market penetration of product  biggest impact (SEO)  
      * functionality => largest impact on user retention ()  
      * usability => ease of user use?  
      * aesthetics => subjective/ audience specific  
      * reach & functionality can be tested automatically during dev  
        * page testing => Mocha (Chai.js asssertion lib) 
        * cross-page testing => Zombie.js  
        * logic testing => unit & integration tests (jasmine???)  
        * linting => jsLint  
        * link checking => Link-Checker
