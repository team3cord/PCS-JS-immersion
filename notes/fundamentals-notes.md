# JS fundamentals notes  

* Lexical scope: is the model based on where variables and blocks of scope are defined by author-time decisions. The lexing phase(tokenizing) of the compiler is essentially able to know where and how all identifiers are declared, and predict how they will be looked-up during execution.  
    * 2 mechanisms can "cheat" lexical scope: eval() and with by creating or modifying scope at runtime. Therefore should be avoided.  
* First class objects: 
* Variable hoisitng: 
* Higher-order functions:  
* Closures:  
* block scope vs function scope:  
* IIFE:  
* Objects:  
  * reference datatypes vs primative datatypes:  
  * obj data properties attributes:  
  * obj literals:
  * obj constructors:
  * obj patterns:
  * obj notation (dot & bracket):
  * obj own & inherited properties:
  * accessing and enumerating properties on obj:
  * accessing inherited properties on obj:  
  * obj serializing and deserializing:
* Functions:  
  * apply & bind:
  * curry: 
  * callbacks:
  * tailcalls: 
  * event handlers:
  * this: 
* Objects & Prototypes:  
* Concurrency: 
* Event Loop:  
* Syntax:  
* Inheritance: 
* Gotchas:  
* ES6:
* Classifiying tools: gulp grunt express node ect.
