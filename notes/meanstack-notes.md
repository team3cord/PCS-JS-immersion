# MEAN stack  

---  

  * [MongoDB](http://www.mongodb.org/)  
  * [Express.js](http://expressjs.com/)  
  * [Angular.js](https://angularjs.org/)  
  * [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/)

### MongoDB  
  
  * NoSQL Document DB  
  * Dynamic Scheme => no need to create the db scheme before building the application  Collections do not enforce document structure.  
  * Binary JSON => data stored as JSON  that adds dates & binary blobs as data types.  
  * Collections => documents live inside collections, there is no need to predefine a collection -- simply start inserting into it and it will have data.  
  * Full index support  
  * Map/Reduce & Aggregation  
  * Scale & Availability  

### Express.js  
  
  * framework for node.js
  * http server  
  * routes  
  * middleware  

### Angular.js  

  * client-side MVC framework  
  * separation of concerns  
  * declarative UI bindings  
  * embeddable => don't need to use angular on the whole app unless you want to 
  * testable => injectable dependence which allow testing   

### Node.js  

  * JavaScript on the server  
  * Google's V8 engine  
  * Non-blocking asyncronous model  (single thread)  
  * npm package manager
