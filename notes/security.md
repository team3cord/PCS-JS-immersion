# Security  

  * XXS => Cross Site Scripting  
  * SSJS injection => server side JS injection  
  * terms  
    * cleartext/ plaintext  
    * ciphertext => reversable  
    * hash => practically impossible to reverse  
    * password salting  => used with hashing, must be unique for each user, makes breaking a computationally infeasible task (rainbow table)  
    * validating users sychronous (validating while everything else is blocked) handles around 4 times less requests each one about three times slower
